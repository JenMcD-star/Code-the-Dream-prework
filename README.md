# Code-the-Dream-prework

My submission for the Code the Dream prework assignment. I made a simple animation where the user can move a skier across a landscape. If hit by one of the yeti's snowballs the screen will flash red with the text 'ouch'.

Project requirements are below.

Please use your Code Sandbox file to create a drawing that includes each of the three following elements:

    use of a conditional statement, and
    use of a loop, and
    use of a function that you write and call in the code.

What you draw is up to you, but feel free to use these ideas as inspiration:

    A city skyline that features some sort of movement –  clouds in the sky, cars on the street, etc.
    An animation featuring a rising sun and a following sunset.
    Abstract art that uses random numbers and loops to determine the placement and size of shapes and objects.

Code the Dream isn’t an art museum – we’re not looking for the next masterpiece. We just want you to demonstrate what you learned in the Khan Academy lesson. You won’t be graded on the quality of your artwork, but will be assessed on how you make use of a working conditional, function, and loop.

To reiterate, you are expected to do your own work for this exercise. Large blocks of copied code will disqualify you.
